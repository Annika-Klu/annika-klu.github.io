    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a trained anthropologist who learned to code in 2020. I was hooked from the start and now
      work as a full stack developer. While I love design and enjoy creative, responsive frontends,
      I've discovered that my true passion is the backend: querying databases, using APIs,
      automating processes. My projects encompass a bit of both worlds, but - apart from a small
      site about coffee with a nice parallax effect (hopefully) that I plan to build - there will be
      mostly data-related projects in the future.
